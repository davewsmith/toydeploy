## To Do

 * Sort out why logging from the app is making it into the logs. (I dimly remember this being something stupid.)
 * Add skeletal tests
 * Add database
   - this'll cause us to split provisioning into roles (webserver, db)
 * Add database migrations
 * sort out how to go into "maintenance" mode while migrations are running
 * figure out how to introduce styling without muddying things up too badly (an app issue, not a provisioning issue)

## Day 1

Installed Ansible into a Python3 virtual environment.

Decided which pi to play with, then created `inventory` as

    [pi]
    pi3 ansible_user=pi

Had to install `sshpass` locally, for reasons I need to review.

    $ ssh-copy-id pi@pi3

prompted for a password, then copied my public key.

Now I can talk to the Pi.

    $ ansible -i inventory -m shell -a "df -h" pi3
    [DEPRECATION WARNING]: Ansible will require Python 3.8 or newer on the controller starting with Ansible 2.12. Current version: 3.6.9 (default, 
    Jan 26 2021, 15:33:00) [GCC 8.4.0]. This feature will be removed from ansible-core in version 2.12. Deprecation warnings can be disabled by 
    setting deprecation_warnings=False in ansible.cfg.

Pesky deprecation warning. Shut it off by creating `ansible.cfg` with

    [defaults]
    deprecation_warnings=False

Now

    $ ansible -i inventory -m debug -a "var=ansible_user" pi3
    pi3 | SUCCESS => {
        "ansible_user": "pi"
    }

This might provide one way of distinguishing between being on a Pi or in a VM. (There's probably a best practice here.)


## Day 2

Added a Vagrantfile with an Ansible provisioner.

    $ vagrant up

builds a 1Gb Ubuntu 18.08 VM and runs a skeletal playbook.

    ok: [default] => {
        "ansible_user": "vagrant"
    }

Nice: One of several ways to adapt to the environment.

To keep things decluttered, playbook and associated stuff will go in `provision/`

In anticipation of AWS, and wanting to avoid `all` meaning both Pis and EC2 instances,
inventories are now `inventory_pi` and `inventory_ec2`

    $ ansible -i inventory_pi -m debug -a "var=ansible_user" all

works.

    $ ansible-playbook -i inventory_pi provision/main.yml

sort of worked. Oddly, that didn't show `df -h` results. But

    $ ansible -i inventory_pi -m shell -a "df -h" pi3

does. Huh?

Wrote the question up and posted to serverfault.com

And... got an answer fairly quickly. I needed to store the result in a var, then using `debug:` to display it.
Odd that the Ansible provisioner in Vagrant behaves differently, but whatever.

Next up, launch a micro instance on EC2.

## Day 3

Yesterday's mystery explained by the `ansible.verbose = 'v'` in Vagrantfile, which caused extra output.

Developing in a VM is convenient. A common thing to do is let Vagrant mount the current directory as '/vagrant',
but that's not in the spirit of a deploy (it's more like using a VM to contain damage). So, a decision:
pull source from github when provisioning, or mount it? I think I'll come down on the side of using the VM as
a development aide, and provision everything except source.

Side trip into ensuring nginx is installed, and putting test.html in place via `template:`.

Pi3 isn't able to complete an `apt-get update`, possibly because it needs an O/S update, so switching to Pi4.
Fortunately, nginx puts things in the same places on both Ubuntu and Raspberry Pi OS, so this part was easy.

Note to self: When before updating Pi3, consult `install.log` and preserve `wxbug`.

Wired things up such that in a VM, the directory that holds the repo is mounted as `/home/vagrant/toydeploy`

On a Pi, the repo gets cloned to `/home/pi/toydeploy`.  The

    when: ansible_user != 'vagrant'

that helps that work gives me a slight itch. On the lookout for a cleaner way.

Selective use of `when_changed: false` to avoid false changes (e.g., `df -h` doesn't have a side-effect).
Also added `cache_valid_time: 3600` to speed things along.

## Day 4

Re-thinking the VM. Aside from isolating changes from the host (my laptop), the VM serves two purposes:

1. an environment for quickly developing Ansible scripts, and
2. a development environment for an App.

These are somewhat in conflict. For app development, being able to edit the same files either inside
the VM or outside (thanks to synced folders) is convenient. But that means skipping the `git clone`
step in provisioning. If, instead of syncing the current directory I were to clone what's in github,
I'd have to do app development exclusively inside the VM and set it up with my private key to push
from there.

Rustled up the parts (and the download) needed to flash the latest Rasperry Pi OS onto the older Pi
I'm using, and a scratch Pi.

Otherwise, no code today.

## Day 5

 * Updated an old Pi 2 with Raspberry Pi OS Lite and plugged it in to the home router
 * `ssh-copy-id` to it
 * installed and up'd `tailscale`
 * pointed `inventory_pi` at the Pi's tailscale ip
 * `$ ansible-playbook -i inventory_pi provision/main.yml`

and voil√†, a minimally provisioned Pi.

## Day 5

Decided to mount `.` as `/vagrant`, and provision to `/home/vagrant/`.
Not the way I'm used to working in a VM, but the VM practices I was introduced to may have been quirky.
This gets rid of the itch from day 3.

Got the app up and serving requests (`http://localhost:8080/` from the VM).

There are a few warts in provisioning that will get revisited when deploy becomes re-deploy. The order of operations needs vetting.

First deploy to the Pi failed because... that's odd... D'oh! After getting the App working in the VM I forgot to push to github. D'oh!

Second deploy to the Pi succeed.

### Scope Creep

This became an excuse to bundle in a fully-featured Flask app, because that's what I'll end up needing to provision.
That's an excuse to revisit a few quirks in app structure...

For purposes of making the app reusable, it has a replaceable `app/toy` blueprint.
